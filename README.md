      A SQL injection attack consists of the insertion or “injection” of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. 
      A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute 
      administration operations on the database (such as shutting down the DBMS), retrieve files, and in some cases, execute commands 
      on the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input 
      to influence the execution of predefined SQL commands.
